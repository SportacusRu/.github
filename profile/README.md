«Sportacus» is not just a website, it’s about life! 

# About
Now, many people are engaged in sports. There are also quite a few who want to incorporate sports into their lives. Not everyone has the opportunity to buy memberships at fitness clubs. Therefore, we present to you a unique project called «Sportacus». This website with a map of outdoor sports facilities can help both beginners and experienced athletes. We hope that our project will benefit a large number of people.

# Task
Our team has decided to create a website that marks places for sports activities in the city of Yekaterinburg. For example, pull-up bars, basketball hoops, volleyball nets, soccer goals, running tracks, tennis tables, and much more.

We want the website to list these places with addresses, photos, and reviews from visitors. Additionally, we plan to add a filter to make it easier for each person to find the sports equipment they are interested in. Users will be able to upload their own photos and addresses of such places, as well as leave ratings.

For the initial content of the site, we intend to use well-known sports facilities. Perhaps we will explore the nearby area and take our own photos and descriptions of the found places.
